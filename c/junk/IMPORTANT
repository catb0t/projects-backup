It's important to note that the information visible in ps can be completely overwritten by the running program. For example, this code:

int main (int argc, char **argv) {
        memset(argv[0], ' ', strlen(argv[0]));
        strcpy(argv[0], "foobar");
        sleep(30);
        return(0);
}
If I compile this into a file called "myprogram" and run it:

$ gcc -o myprogram myprogram.c
$ ./myprogram &
[1] 10201
And then run ps, I'll see a different process name:

$ ps -f -p 10201
UID        PID  PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
lars     10201  9734  0 11:37 pts/10   00:00:00 foobar
