
False.F    - ANS Forth source for a False interpreter
FalseCom.F - semi-ANS Forth source for a DOS 386 False compiler

You just need a 32 bit ANS Forth system to load 'em. Or you can
use Dad (Bruce Hoyt) and my BEForth (FalseCom.EXE with no parameters).

Then type "INCLUDE False.F" or "INCLUDE FalseCom.F" and you're away.

See the extended comment at the start of False.F for more information.

And email me (Benjamin Hoyt) at benhoyt@clear.net.nz to inform me of
any bugs in this False suite. (But go to Wouter van Oortmerssen's
site at http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~wvo96r/ to tell him how cool/silly
False is. :-) Have fun!
