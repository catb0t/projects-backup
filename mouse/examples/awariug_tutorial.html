  Awari is an ancient African game played with seven sticks
and thirty-six stones or beans laid out as shown above.  The
board is divided into six compartments or pits on each side.
In addition, there are two special home pits at the ends.

<P>

  A move is made by taking all of the beans from any (non-empty)
pit on your own side.  Starting from the pit to the right of
this one, these beans are 'sown' one in each pit working around
the board anticlockwise.

<P>

  A turn consists of one or two moves.  If the last bean of
your move is sown in your own home you make take a second move.

<P>

  If the last bean sown in a move lands in an empty pit,
provided that the opposite pit is not empty, all the beans in
the opposite pit, together with the last bean sown are
'captured' and moved to the player's home.

<P>

  When either side is empty, the game is finished.  The player
with the most beans in his home has won.

<P>

  In the computer version, the board is printed as 14 numbers
representing the 14 pits.

<PRE>


                      3 3 3 3 3 3
                   0               0
                      3 3 3 3 3 3


</PRE>

  The pits on your (lower) side are numbered 1-6 from left
to right.  The pits on my (the computer's) side are numbered
from my left (your right).

<P>

  To make a move you type in the number of a pit.  If the
last bean lands in your home, the computer types 'AGAIN?'
and you then type in your second move.

<P>

  The computer's move is typed, followed by a diagram of the
board in its new state.  The computer always offers you the
first move.  This is considered to be a slight advantage.

<P>

  There is a learning mechanism in the program that causes
the play of the computer to improve as it plays more games.

<P>

  Use the 'break' key sequence (e.g. Ctrl-C on a PC computer)
to stop execution of the program.

<P>

  The BASIC version of Awari published by Creative Computing
is adopted from one originally written by Geoff Wyvill of
Bradford, Yorkshire, England.  The Mouse-2002 version was
adopted from the BASIC version by David G. Simpson of
Laurel, Maryland, USA.
