#However in computing, to make things easier, an integer is any whole number. Both x and x-(x*2) [[can also be written as x=0-x]] are integers
#A character is any singular visual symbol intended for human interpretation: in ASCII a character is any value between 0 ({}) and 127 ({}) or 255 ({}) in ASCII Extended. A string is any literal collection of characters: 5 is an integer while '5' is implicitly a string.
