Instead of following your friends (as if you ever had them), you elect to stay home, tapping on a keyboard, like the boring loser you are. No adventure for you, I suppose. No death, either, though, so maybe that’s a plus.” —PRESS ANY KEY—</p>

New England gets very dark. Some people think it gets darker here than in other places in the world. Perhaps, you muse, it's all the creatures in the night, the slendermen and werewolves, who embody the absence of light. You slump, stationary, behind a harsh computer monitor beside a window in your room, staring at a text document. It's an old Apple box, and it's been nearly ten years since the operating system got an update. This is, of course, as high as it will go, until I start tossing out some of the old, crappy hardware. The shell script I'm writing isn't working, and I'm about to give up for now and mess around with striped volumes on some of these single-gigabyte thumb drives on my desk, when I'm startled by a knock on the screen door, directly below the road-facing window in my room. Due to the unique way in which my house is built (an a-frame), the knock sounds like it could have come from the wall directly above my head, making it all the more unnerving.
