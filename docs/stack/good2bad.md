I won't post any specific links (partially because I'm on mobile and thus lazy, but partially because I don't want to induce the meta-effect), but every now and then I see an objectively bad question, which garners a downvote or three , close votes and a few answers.

*Sometimes*, this question will garner also answers, posted before the question gets closed. If the question gets a high-quality, well-orchestrated answer or two, typically it seems the question will accumulate downvotes and the good answers will accumulate (many) upvotes.

The policy across all the sites in the SE network is that users are free and entitled to vote how they please without retaliation or fear of punishment.* SE also encourage users to upvote good answers and downvote bad ones.

Stack Overflow, Programmers, and Code Review, among others, all have (unspoken?) sometimes-enforced, informal *recommendations* that answers of any merit to objectively bad or actively harmful questions should be discouraged, downvoted and voted for deletion This is to the end of lessening the amount of free rep gained from answering too-easy "low-hanging fruit", etc, and lowering the number of bad questions posted.

Here, though, it seems the community almost *encourages* good answers to bad questions

\* -1 rep per downvote is not *punishment*, it's *abuse throttling*.
