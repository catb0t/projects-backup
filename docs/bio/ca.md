# marshmallow creature conclusion prompt

Your marshmallow creature is the result of the genes it received from its Mom and Dad.  Using the genetics vocabulary terms below AND your data from the lab, discuss HOW your creature received the traits that it has.  You do not have to explain every trait, but you must use examples from your creature.  To receive credit for using a vocab term, you need to use the term in context of your creatureâ€™s formation and trait expression; do not just define the term.
HINT: Organize your scientific-writing conclusion into paragraphs, discussing; sex cell formation, production of the zygote, and why your traits are the way they are.

Terms to use:
```
Genotype             Dominant            Meiosis
Phenotype            Recessive           Fertilization
Gene                 Heterozygous        Gamete
Allele               Homozygous
```

**Remember**: These terms must be used in context of your lab to demonstrate your command of the biological language.  **Underline** or high-light the terms when used in proper context.

## sex cell formation

The list of characteristics (nose presence, eye colour, etc) and the method of selection among the chromosomes present -- using "random" sampling -- simulated **meiosis**.

## how these traits came to be

For a given trait, the **genotype** was selected via blind human orchestration, and the **phenotype** was decided by examining the **dominant** and **recessive** traits to discern in which traits the zygote was **heterozygous** or **homozygous**.

## production of the zygote

The zygote was produced by a selection of **alleles** inherited from its parents, and was constructed with these in mind.
