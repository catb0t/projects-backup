# Documentation

The documentation lives in the docs/ directory here in this repository, and gets served to the site via the x-api. It should contain at minimim:

- [x] `INSTALLATION.md` - about how to get the language set up locally.
- [ ] `TESTS.md` - about how to run the tests for the exercises.

Some nice to haves:

- [x] `ABOUT.md` - a short, friendly blurb about the language. What types of problems does it solve really well? What is it typically used for?
- [x] `LEARNING.md` - a few notes about where people might want to go to learn the language from scratch.
- [x] `RESOURCES.md` - references and other useful resources.
