**Bash icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/bash.png
We are using an unofficial logo of the GNU Bash project created by Justin Dorfman. It's not clear under which terms it's released. We believe that our adaptation, changing the colours, falls under fair use.

**Crystal icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/crystal.png
The Crystal logo is assumed to be owned by Manas SA. It appears to be released under version 2.0 of the Apache license, along with the Crystal codebase. It may also fall within the public domain, since the version we are using is a geometric shape. We have cropped it for use on Exercism.

**Groovy icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/groovy.png
The version of the Groovy logo adapted for use on Exercism was created by Stefan Becker (Zorak1103) and is released under verison 3.0 of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license. We have changed the colour palette for Exercism.

**Haxe icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/haxe.png
The Haxe logo is assumed to be owned by the Haxe Foundation, but this is not made explicit. We have adapted it, changing the colours, for use on Exercism, which we believe to fall under fair use.

**Nim icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/nim.png
The Nim logo is assumed to be owned by Andreas Rumpf. It appears to be released under the MIT license, along with the Nim codebase. We've adapted the official Nim logo by changing the colors, which we believe falls under fair use.

**NASM icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/nim.png
The NASM logo is Copyright 2012 H. Peter Anvin. We have adapted it, tweaking the colours, for use on Exercism. We are using it to identify the NASM language and platform itself, not any part of Exercism, which we believe to be admissible under fair use.

**R icon** http://exercism.io/img/tracks/r.png
The R logo was created by Hadley Wickham and others at RStudio. The original file is licensed under version 4.0 of the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike license. We have adapted it, changing the colour scheme, for use on Exercism.
