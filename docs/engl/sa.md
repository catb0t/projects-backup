# Rewatch: Capra’s It’s a Wonderful Life (1946)

When it comes to the most classic feature films for the Christmas season, it’s hard to top director Frank Capra’s 1946 It’s a Wonderful Life, starring James Stewart, Donna Reed and Henry Travers. The film, based on Philip Van Doren Stern‘s 1939 short story The Greatest Gift, follows George Bailey (James Stewart), a man who has given his life and dreams for the benefit of those around him, as he is tested by the evils of the world, and saved by an angel named Clarence Odbody (Henry Travers). The film imbues a traditional narrative of contemporary good and evil, while preserving the Christmas spirit and the idea that, to quote Clarence, “no man who has friends is a failure”.
